# Calculator-Project1
#Overview
#Build a calculator web app using HTML, SCSS, and JS.
#The end goal here is to have a site which can accept inputs, do some calculations and give you the correct output. Inputs will be generated from users clicking on the #calculator buttons.
#Use the iPhone calculator shown here as a design, feel free to use any other calculator design you can find on Dribbble, or make one from scratch if you're feeling #creative!
#Requirements
#A deployed website (using GitHub Pages)
#A public GitHub repository for your codebase
#A README.md with a short intro to the project
#At least 15 Git commits for the different stages in your development
#Be responsive and built mobile-first, it should work on different screen widths
#Accept a minimum of 2 inputs, perform an operation and show the output
#DOES NOT USE THE eval() method (as this is extremely dangerous)
#Code is highly readable (good naming and indented correctly)
#Let's build!

#We’re aiming for the following goals for this project:
#A working Calculator: The main task is to create a Calculator not only will this test your understanding of JavaScript but how you break down a problem.
#Practice using Git and GitHub flow: We want you to get as much practice as possible using git, GitHub and the command line
#Apply what you are learning: This is a great place to apply what you have been learningon all of the course so far. When you get it functioning really push on the UI, #use SCSS, BEM, anything else you find on the web....really go mad!

#Hints
#PSEUDOCODE: Do it. Trust me, you will thank yourself.
#Beware of following a “How to make a calculator in JS tutorial”. Watching a video is not the same as learning to code. Some of the stuff you’ll have to do we won’t have #covered but try your best to search to solutions to the next step of problem not the whole problem
#Normal rules for copying from online apply, if you can’t explain it, you can’t use it.
